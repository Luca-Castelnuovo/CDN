# ConfigCat SDK for PHP
https://configcat.com

ConfigCat SDK for PHP provides easy integration for your application to ConfigCat.

ConfigCat is a feature flag and configuration management service that lets you separate releases from deployments. You can turn your features ON/OFF using <a href="http://app.configcat.com" target="_blank">ConfigCat Management Console</a> even after they are deployed. ConfigCat lets you target specific groups of users based on region, email or any other custom user attribute.

## Getting started

### 1. Install the package with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
```shell
composer require configcat/configcat-client
```

### 2. Go to <a href="https://app.configcat.com/connect" target="_blank">Connect your application</a> tab to get your *API Key*:
![API-KEY](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConfigCat/php-sdk/master/media/readme01.png  "API-KEY")

### 3. Create the *ConfigCat* client instance
```php
$client = new \ConfigCat\ConfigCatClient("#YOUR-API-KEY#");
```

### 4. Get your setting value:
```php
$isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled = $client->getValue("isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled", false);
if(is_bool($isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled) && $isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled) {
    doTheNewThing();
} else {
    doTheOldThing();
}
```

## Getting user specific setting values with Targeting
Using this feature, you will be able to get different setting values for different users in your application by passing a `User Object` to the `getValue()` function.

Read more about [Targeting here](https://docs.configcat.com/docs/advanced/targeting/).


## User object
Percentage and targeted rollouts are calculated by the user object you can optionally pass to the configuration requests.
The user object must be created with a **mandatory** identifier parameter which should uniquely identify each user:
```php
$user = new \ConfigCat\User("#USER-IDENTIFIER#"); // mandatory

$isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled = $client->getValue("isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled", false, $user);
if(is_bool($isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled) && $isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled) {
    doTheNewThing();
} else {
    doTheOldThing();
}
```
